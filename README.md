• What is this for?
This addon is a modification of the original add-on Censored Faces of the Players from RG Studio. In this version, the method of handling censorship was changed, allowing it to be adapted for use on the faces of non-player characters (NPCs).

• Important: The addon may not work with players, also the addon needs to be enabled in the post-processing menu.
